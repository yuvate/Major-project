Abstract—Account compromisation is a serious threat to users
of Online Social Networks (OSNs). While relentless spammers
exploit the established trust relationships between account owners
and their friends to efficiently spread malicious spam, timely detection
of compromised accounts are quite challenging due to the
well established trust relationship between the service providers,
account owners, and their friends. In this paper, we study the
social behaviors of OSN users, i.e. their usage of OSN services,
and the application of which in detecting compromised accounts.
In particular, we propose a set of social behavioral features that
can effectively characterize the user social activities on OSNs.
We validate the efficacy of these behavioral features by collecting
and analyzing real user clickstreams to an OSN website. Based
on our measurement study, we devise individual user’s social
behavioral profile by combining its respective behavioral feature
metrics. A social behavioral profile accurately reflects a user’s
OSN activity patterns. While an authentic owner conforms to
its account’s social behavioral profile involuntarily, it is hard
and costly for impostors to feign. We evaluate the capability
of the social behavioral profiles in distinguishing different OSN
users, and our experimental results show the social behavioral
profiles can accurately differenti
